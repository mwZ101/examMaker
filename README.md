# ExamMaker

The ExamMaker application executable can be found in the dist folder. 

The user inputs a database containing a sets of questions, answers, and difficulty levels in .csv format. The user then inputs how many of each question from a particular difficulty level is desired (eg. 3 easy questions, 2 medium questions, 1 hard question) and how many versions of the exam is needed. The program will then select random questions for each difficulty level from the database and save files of each version.
